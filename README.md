## pwndocker

[Awesome docker for pwn by skysider!!!](https://github.com/skysider/pwndocker)

## Requirement

- Already set up your pwndocker

- Lazy

## Before Start

My default working path is on **~/Desktop/pwndocker**

and my **${ctf_name}(container name)** is **pwndocker**

You **NEED** replace the path and name with your preferences or make your setting the same as me.

For mac users, you can use automator to edit the .app file.

## pwndocker opener (Automator app)

Nothing special and very simple Script, but...

If you are lazy like me ...

You can just download this and copy pwndocker.app to **/Application** very gracefully!

(Make sure all your path and container name is set up correctly)

Enjoy :)

## Shell Script

Although this project is mainly for mac os.

But also support shell script (startup.sh)

## Comming soon

Maybe I will add an option to load specific libc from this script

But, I'm so lazy XD

When I need this feature, I will create it at that time !!!

And welcome to open Pull Request !!!
